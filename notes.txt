props are immutable, passed to component, owned by parent not changed by children

state managed within component, can be changed

setState = asynchronous, use callback if need to execute code after state change


pure component
  = implements shouldComponentUpdate with a shallow props and state comparison
  = prevent uncessary renders (for performance boost)
  = never mutate state, always return a new object that reflects a new state


React.memo is equivalent of PureComponent but in functional components

Refs = to access DOM nodes in react (RefsDemo.js, FocusInput.js)
     = refs can only be attached to class components
     = useRef hook can be used if functional components
